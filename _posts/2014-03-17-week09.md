In class
--------

On Monday, we will finish up the topic of permutation testing.  For class, you will want:
* permtest.R
* sap.zip

On Wednesday, we will discuss the model-building process.  

The exercise [(ZIP file here)](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/exercises/exercises07.zip) this week is a data-analysis problem where you must build a regression model from scratch, with little prior guidance about what variables to include.
