In class
--------

On Monday, we discuss sampling distributions and frequentist inference.  Key concepts:
* Parameter uncertainty and prediction uncertainty
* Sampling distributions
* Bootstrapping: the why and the how
* Standard error, confidence interval, and frequentist coverage

Data and R scripts for Monday: 
* gonefishing.csv and gonefishing.R
* the marketmodel.csv data set from Homework 2

On Wednesday, we will discuss the normal (or Gaussian) linear regression model. Key concepts:
* The normal distribution: residuals as aggregations of nudges
* Quantifying parameter and prediction uncertainty in the Gaussian regression model
* The t statistic as a signal-to-noise ratio for coefficient estimates

Data and R scripts for Wednesday: TBA
