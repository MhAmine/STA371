In class
--------

On Monday, we learn the technique of combining and transforming variables to fit more flexible functions to data.  Key concepts:
* Constructing new variables from existing ones
* Transforming variables to fit logarithmic, exponential, and power-law relationships
* Nonlinear curve fitting via polynomial regression

Data and R scripts for Monday: 
* trafficdeaths.R and trafficdeaths.csv
* transformations.R and infmort.csv
* utilities.R and utilities.csv
* milk.csv


On Wednesday, we will focus on the prediction uncertainty associated with a linear model. Key concepts:
* Quantiles and coverage intervals.
* Naive prediction intervals.
* The decomposition of variance and R^2.
* Sample correlation.

Data and R scripts for Wednesday: TBA


Read, watch, practice
---------------------

For Monday, read the course packet, Chapter 2 (pages 60-70); Tufte, Ex. 6 on page 108.  For Wednesday, read the course packet, Chapter 3; Kaplan, Chapter 4.

Exercises
---------
The exercises this week [(PDF file here)](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/exercises/exercises03.pdf) are about transformations, nonlinear models, and prediction uncertainty.  They are due on Monday, February 3.
