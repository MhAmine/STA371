On Monday, we will continue our discussion of utility, and introduce
the use of Monte Carlo simulation to model decision problems with
complicated stochastic outcomes.
You will want the R script called [MonteCarloIntro.R](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371/r/MonteCarloIntro.R).

For Wednesday, we will continue our unit on Monte Carlo simulation.  For reading, finish up the  _Notes on
Utility_ section from the Resources Tab.  Please also read
professional poker player Phil Laak's take on the Kelly criterion:
