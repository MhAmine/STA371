In class
--------

On Monday, we will continue our discussion of utility, and introduce
the use of Monte Carlo simulation to model decision problems with
complicated stochastic outcomes.


For Wednesday, we will continue our unit on Monte Carlo
simulation. You will want the R scripts called
[MonteCarloIntro.R](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371/r/MonteCarloIntro.R)
and
 [Portfolio.R](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371/r/Portfolio.R).

For reading, finish up the  _Notes on
Utility_ section from the Resources Tab.  Please also read
professional poker player Phil Laak's take on the Kelly criterion:
