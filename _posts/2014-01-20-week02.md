In class
--------

There is no class on Monday, which is a university holiday.  Happy MLK Day!

On Wednesday, we talk about ordinary least squares for fitting simple regression models. Key concepts:
* the parameters of a statistical model
* the least-squares criterion
* fitted values and residuals in a linear regression model
* interpretation of the intercept and slope.
R scripts: afc.R, pickup.R
R skills: make a scatter plot; fit a least-squares line; extract the coefficients, residuals, and
fitted values; superimpose the line on the scatter plot

Data and R scripts for class: 
* pickup.R and pickup.csv
* kidney.csv

Read, watch, practice
