In class
--------

On Monday, we go over homework 6, and introduce two new ideas: the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and permutation tests.

On Wednesday, we will talk about Neyman-Pearson testing, especially as it applies in regression.  Key concepts:

* test statistic, critical value, and rejection region
* the alpha level as a frequentist guarantee
* p-values as a summary of evidence
* F tests and analysis of variance

Data and R scripts for Wednesday: TBA

Read, watch, practice
---------------------
For Wednesday, read Chapter 7 of the course packet (Quantifying Uncertainty: Part II), which covers hypothesis testing.
