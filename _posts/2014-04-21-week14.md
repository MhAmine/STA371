In class
--------

On Monday, we will continue with Monte Carlo simulation, focusing on
the very useful technique of bootstrap resampling to study
asset-allocation problems.  Today's chief lesson is about the value of diversification!

[This week's homework](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371/exercises/exercises10.zip)
is the capstone problem of the semester.  It brings together
everything we've learned so far in a single case study.
it is due on Wednesday, April 30 (the last class day of the semester).
Good luck!
