In class
--------

On Monday, we review material on inference in the basic one-variable regression model using normality assumptions.  We will then introduce grouping variables in regression.  Key concepts:
* Review of parameter uncertainty and prediction uncertainty
* t-statistics, confidence intervals, and frequentist coverage
* Aggregation paradoxes and grouping variables in regression modeling

On Wednesday, we will continue with our discussions of grouping variables in regression:
* baseline/offset form, dummy variables, and interaction terms
* aggregation paradoxes

Data and R scripts for Wednesday: 
* house.csv and baseballsalary.csv
* baseballsalary.R
