In class
--------

On Monday, we will learn about logistic regression, a useful
technique for building predictive models of binary outcomes.  This
material comes from
[Chapter 9 of the course packet](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371/files/09-BinaryOutcomes.pdf).
The relevant data sets and R scripts are:
* bballbets.csv and orings.csv
* bballbets.R  

On Wednesday, we will wrap up with a short review of what
we've learned in the second half of the semester.  I will close things
off with a reminder of some common fallacies in decision-making and
data-based reasoning that we've encountered in this course, and that
all educated people should be aware of.
