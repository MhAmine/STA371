In class

This week, we talk briefly about the perils of causal reasoning using data.  Then we talk about some basic methods for exploring multivariate data.

Data and R scripts for class: 
* [titanic.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/titanic.R)
* [citytemps.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/citytemps.R), [casandie.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/data/casandie.txt), and [sdrapcty.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/data/sdrapcty.txt)
* [mammalsleep.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/mammalsleep.R)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Two steps are the most important.

* Reading: TBA
* Install [R](http://http://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  RStudio is not required, but is a very nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetive steps (e.g. loading data) very intuitive.  RStudio won't work unless you install R first.

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, watch and follow along with these videos from the [R Tutorial](http://dist.stat.tamu.edu/pub/rvideos/) website:

1. Libraries and Packages
2. Reading in Files
3. Inputting Data
