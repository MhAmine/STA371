In class
--------

On Monday, we talk briefly about the perils of causal reasoning using data.  Key concepts: 
* confounding
* dependence graphs
* blinding and placebos
* longitudinal and cross-sectional studies
* natural experiments

On Wednesday, we talk about some basic methods for exploring multivariate data. Key concepts:
* continuous and grouping variables
* contingency tables
* simple summaries and graphics: histogram, boxplot, dotplot, scatter plot, lattice plot
* variation between and within groups
* simple group-wise models
* fitted values and residuals
* group means versus baseline/offset form

Data and R scripts for class: 
* [titanic.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/titanic.R)
* [citytemps.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/citytemps.R), [casandie.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/data/casandie.txt), and [sdrapcty.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/data/sdrapcty.txt)
* [ut2000.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/ut2000.R)
* [mammalsleep.R](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/r/mammalsleep.R)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

The first thing to do is to install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  RStudio is not required, but is highly recommended.  It provides a very nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetive steps (e.g. loading data) very intuitive.  RStudio will not work unless you install R first.

Readings:
* For Monday, read Chapter 1 of the course packet, and Chapter 1 of Kaplan.
* For Wednesday, read Chapter 2 (pages 25-36 only) of the course packet, and Chapters 2-3 of Kaplan.

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, follow along with Chapters 1-3 of Kaplan.  You may also watch and follow along with these videos from the [R Tutorial](http://dist.stat.tamu.edu/pub/rvideos/) website:
# Libraries and Packages
# Reading in Files
# Inputting Data
# Getting Help in R
# Saving Work
# Basic Statistics

Exercises
---------
The exercises this week [(zip file here)](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/exercises/exercises01.zip) involve two goals:
# to hone your intuition for assessing the quality of evidence offered in support of a claim about cause and effect.
# to practice some basic exploratory data analysis in R.

They are due on Wednesday, January 22.

For the first question, you will need to read the following article, from the New York Times on October 3rd, 2011:
[Contraceptive Used in Africa May Double Risk of H.I.V.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/health/04hiv.html), by Pam Belluck. If you are not an online subscriber to the New York Times, and have run out of your free page views this month, you may retrieve the article through UT&apos; LexisNexis Academic subscription:
1. Visit [LexisNexis](http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/) through the library webpage and log on using your UT EID.
2. Search for the phrase &quot;Contraceptive Said to Double Risks of H.I.V.&quot; (with the quotation marks) in the &quot;Search for&quot; box under &quot;Search the News.&quot;  When I do this, the article is the second result to come up.
