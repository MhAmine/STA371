This is midterm week.  On Monday, we have a structured review session in class [(handout here.)](http://jgscott.github.com/STA371/files/midterm-concepts.pdf)

On Tuesday evening from 6:30 to 7:45 PM, I will hold a question-and-answer session in UTC 4.112.

The midterm exam is Wednesday in class.  Please bring a pen and a blue book.
