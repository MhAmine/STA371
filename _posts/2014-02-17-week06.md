In class
--------

On Monday, we review material on dummy variables, and continue the idea of interactions.  Key concepts:

* Models with more than one grouping predictor (batches of related dummy variables)
* Interactions: when one variable modulates the effect of another.

Data and R scripts for Monday:
 
* baseball.csv and baseball.R again
* house.csv

On Wednesday, we will introduce multiple regression, used for models that incorporate more than one numerical predictor.  Key concepts:

* the geometry of multiple regression: planes through point clouds
* the interpretation of the coefficients: partial slopes, holding other variables constant, etc.


Data and R scripts for Wednesday:
 
* salary.csv and salary.R
* carauction.csv and carauction.R
* gala.csv and gala.R

Read, watch, practice
