On Monday, we will finish up time series by spending some time with
the peakdemand.csv data set, available from the Data tab.  We will
then transition to the next major set of topics on probability, risk
modeling, and decision analysis.  Topics include:
* Basic probability rules for discrete events
* Addition and multiplication rules
* Bayes' rule and conditional probability
* Discrete random variables their probability distributions  


On Wednesday, we will continue our discussion of probability by
talking about:
* Continuous random variables and the PDF/CDF
* Joint distributions of more than one quantity  

Before the start of next week, please read the _Notes on Probability_ and _Notes on Random Variables_
from the Resources Tab of the website.

No exercises this week, or next: focus on your projects!  They are due
on Monday, April 7th.
